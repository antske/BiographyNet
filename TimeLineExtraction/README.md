Timeline Extraction
============

Program that takes lists of events and their temporal relations (link to time anchor, relation to other events) as input and orders the events according to their time of occurrence.

The input can be a directory with lists of events extracted from various documents, where the algorithm will first create timelines on a document level and then merge them into a global timeline.

This software is still in a development stage and lacks proper documentation. Questions and request concerning this software can be sent to antske.fokkens@vu.nl
